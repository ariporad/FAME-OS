To speed up access to large files, it is generally preferred to map them to memory rather
than access them via standard read/write. The mapped file can be accessed as a memory area
accessible by a pointer (an array). This functionality is made possible by the virtual memory
mechanism.
To map a file, we use the "mmap" function (and "munmap" to close the memory mapping).
1. Create a test.txt file containing some text.
2. Open this file (via "open"), get its size back (via "fstat").
3. Map the entire file to memory.
4. Reverse the bytes of the file (the start bytes of the file are at the end).
5. End memory mapping.
6. Check that the text in the file has been reversed ("cat test.txt").
